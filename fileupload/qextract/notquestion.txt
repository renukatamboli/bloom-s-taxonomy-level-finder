  The entire content of the array A having N elements should change without using any other array. 
   Example : if the array Arr contains 23 20 5 11 10   
   Then the array should become 46 60 10 22 30 
   The function should not display the content of the array. 
   Assuming the parameter N represents number of Row and the parameter M represents number of Columns
   For example, if the content of array M having N as 4 and M as 5 is as follows : 
The function should find the sum and display the same as :  
 Sum of Top Row : 150   
 Sum of Bottom Row : 75

 All elements found on the periodic table have certain distinct properties. 
 Elements are single types of atoms, while atoms are the fundamental building blocks of all matter. 
 Gold, for  instance, is a soft, naturally occurring metal known for being beautiful and  desired. 
 Gold is  malleable,  and  while  it is  found  naturally  in  the  environment,  it  is  often  reworked  and  incorporated into fine jewelry. 
 Oxygen is a necessary and naturally occurring element. 
 It's an invisible, odorless gas that's a crucial part of the air we breathe and necessary for our bodies to function properly. 
 Often, elements like those noted are combined in varying ways to create  new chemical substances.    
 Chemical substances  react in certain ways and also have certain discernible properties. 
 For instance, when an  oxygen atom and two hydrogen atoms come together they form water,  which is essential to life. 
 When the atoms of a specific substance are regrouped, a new  substance is  formed  with  often  vastly  different  properties  from  the  original  substance.
  Occasionally, something completely harmless, or even necessary, can become dangerous or lethal when its molecules (a grouping of two or more atoms) are regrouped.   
The components of table when their atoms are rearranged. 
It is  an  interesting chemical humans, when you separate you are left with something The components of salt are consumption and even contact. 
when it comes into contact with water, has the  potential to be combustible an extremely caustic  and cleaning agent; it is commonly mixed with other chemicals people to swim in swimming. 
Answer the following questions in ONE or TWO sentences: 
The creation of carbon monoxide is an effect. 
Table salt can be separated into sodium and chlorine. 
Sodium is explosive. 
Chlorine is a gas that can kill people.  
Subject Code: R161101/R16      
salt are a good example of how different substances rearranged.  
Common  table  salt,  also  known  as  sodium chemical compound because, while it is commonly consumed separate its elementssodium and chlorine something quite different  from the edible seasoning known are sodium and chlorine, both of which are harmful contact. 
Sodium requires great care when being handled. 
the reaction can be flammable, while powdered combustible (explosive) in oxygen or air. 
 Chlorine is used primarily commonly used in swimming pools to render them sanit chemicals and diluted for these purposes. 
 This is what makes swimming pools. 
  Answer the following questions in ONE or TWO sentences: 
  Mark will be awarded only if you write TWO synonyms, NOT one.

 For any given problem, there is often more than one solution. 
In some cases, there are very  few solutions. In others, a countless array of perfectly good solutions can be introduced.   
Without a system for testing each solution to figure out which is best, wed have no quantifiable way of figuring out which one to choose.  
Once a hypothesis, or potential solution to a problem, is in place, it needs to be tested. 
More than one hypothesis can be tested, and results should be  carefully recorded.  
Some solutions are more easily identifiable as being the best. 
For example: the quickest  route from home to school; the gear ratio that will make it easiest and most efficient to ride  your bike; the best time of year to plant tomatoes. 
All of these solutions address very  specific, concrete problems and are highly testable. 
And once you have found a satisfactory solution you may not have to do too much testing. The solution will remain satisfactory indefinitely, as      long  as all other variables remain constant.    
Of course, there are other problems we encounter  where the solution set is wideranging and  more openended.     
Have you ever heard the  expression to build a better mousetrap?
Its an old saying that  refers to a problemsolving  endeavor that invites inventors and engineers to endlessly  reimagine new and better solutions. 
In this case, the problem is very old and famously banal catching mice.

 They (rush) him to the nearby hospital. 
 The doctor immediately (attend) to him and (diagnose) it to be appendicitis. 
 Later, Harry (undergo) a surgery. Now, he (recover) completely and (be) back to school.  [
 Read the passage below and answer the questions that follow. 
 A rugged young hunter pauses after a successful deer hunt as his dogs bark and jump  around him excitedly. 
 He stands motionless, his serious gaze turned downward and his  bent leg resting  on the root of a large, sawedoff tree stump. 
 A deerskin and rifle are  slung over his shoulders, and antlers dangle from one hand. 
 His hunting skills are key to his survival because he will sell the skin and antlers. 
 This somber scene is set in the  Adirondack Mountains of New York State. 
  The sky is gray and overcast, with just a hint of sun and blue sky shining through the clouds.
   The distant mountains look cold and  dark, and the oranges, yellows, and golds of autumn in the nearby trees and underbrush  are fading to wintry browns. 
   The only living creatures in this lonely landscape are the  huntsman and his dogs.  
    Winslow Homer became an artist after working as a magazine illustrator. 
    He was a great admirer of nature and took hunting vacations in the Adirondacks with his brother  for forty years.
    Because he wanted to capture the mood and feeling of being in nature, Homer patiently  observed the natural world and recorded it as realistically as possible.
 Consider two cache organizations: The first one is 32 KB 2-way set associative with 32-byte block size. 
 The second one is of the same size but direct mapped.
  The size of an address is 32 bits in both cases.
   A 2-to-1 multiplexer has a latency of 0.6 ns while a k bit comparator has a latency of k/10 ns. 
   The hit latency of the set associative organization is h1 while that of the direct mapped one is h2.
  In many computers the cache block size is in the range 32 to 128 bytes. 
An eight-way set-associative cache consists of a total of 256 blocks.

    Analyze that a  data  warehouse consists of the three dimensions time, doctor and patient, and the two measures count and charge, where charge is the fee  that a doctor charges a patient for a visit.
      Suppose that a data warehouse for Big University consists of the following four  dimensions:  student,  course,  semester,  and  instructor,  and  two measures count and avg grade. 
      When at the lowest conceptual level (e.g., for a given student, course, semester, and instructor combination), the avg grade measure stores the actual course grade of the student. 
      At higher combination (e.g.,  roll-up  from  semester  to  year  ) Should one perform inorder to list the average grade of  CS courses for each Big University student.

Assume roll number, name and marks of a student are stored in a database.
India has deployed aerial drones over Kaziranga National Park in Assam state in a bid to protect endangered one-horned rhinos from poachers. 
Kaziranga chief NK Vasu said the maiden drone flight on Monday was a milestone in wildlife protection.
The park is home to two-thirds of the worlds one-horned rhino population and also has a large number of elephants, tigers and other wildlife. 
In recent months, rhinos have been killed in large numbers by poachers. 
Drones and other successful anti-poaching measures have also been used by the WWF in nearby Chitwan National Park in Nepal, where the hunting of one-horned rhinos has been drastically reduced. 
The Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) was up in the sky for 15 minutes. 
It landed safely, Mr. Vasu said. 
We hope this technology will go a long way in effective surveillance of the park. Assam Forest Minister Rockybul Hussain said this was the first time that drones had been used for wildlife protection anywhere in India. 
The UAVs will deter poachers who will now have to reckon with surveillance from air as well as on ground, MrHussain said. 
The minister said it would now be possible to keep an eye on the remotest parts of the 480 sq km (185 sq miles) park. 
The drones can fly a pre-programmed route at a maximum elevation of 200m (656ft) for up to 90 minutes, officials say. 
They are light enough to be launched by hand and will be able to take images of the ground below with a still or video camera, they add. 
Twenty-two one-horned rhinos were killed in Kaziranga by poachers last year. 
In the first three years of this month, 16 rhinos have been killed, triggering a furore in Assam where the animal is seen as a symbol of regional pride and is also valued for drawing tourists to the state. 
A rhino census in Kaziranga last month said that there were about 2,300 of the animals in Kaziranga.

that bear relation to heat and work. General laws of energy transformations concerning all types of systems, mechanical,
electrical and chemical may fall within the purview of this science. It is a science based on a number of empirical laws
formed by experimentation from which all predictions concerning the physical behavior of the system may be deduced
by logical reasoning. The findings have been formalized into certain basic laws, which are known as Zeroth, First,
Second and Third laws of thermodynamics. Power cycles and refrigeration cycle based on thermodynamic system is
